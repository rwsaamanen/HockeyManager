# HockeyManager
Application to manage hockey matches and statistics

To get started:

Eclipse:

Open eclipse using directory where HockeyManager is cloned.
Import -> Existing Projects into Workspace -> HockeyManager.
Then you should be able to run MainFrame.java


Currently HockeyManager uses predefined players. 
However players.csv file can be modified using application itself or purely editing .csv file.

The Project is part of a school course.
